# Antique_zone_nodejs

This is a project made with Node js environment. The main aim of that project was to create a website that acquires all the files through server side rendering. In this project I have used html template to render all the data from server and send the files according to the request. Real database is not present in this project and all the data was rendered from a json file that is part of this project files. Different Node js modules like fs, http, url were used to complete this project.
